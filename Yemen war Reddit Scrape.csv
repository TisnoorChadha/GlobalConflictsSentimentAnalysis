"In Short, What happened (Credit goes to Journalist and AP News)

* In a break with the president, Congress voted for the first time earlier this month to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try to stop U.S. involvement in a foreign conflict.

* The veto — the second in Trump’s presidency — was expected. Congress lacks the votes to override him - Despite the fact that Both the House and the Senate voted to end US involvement. House approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247-175 vote and The Senate vote last month was 54-46.

Response from Trump and the Congress

* “This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump wrote in explaining his veto.

* Congress has grown uneasy with Trump’s close relationship with Saudi Arabia as he tries to further isolate Iran, a regional rival.

* Many lawmakers also criticized the president for not condemning Saudi Arabia for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States and had written critically about the kingdom. Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October and never came out. Intelligence agencies said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing.

* The U.S. provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. **Members of Congress have expressed concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014.** Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voted to end U.S. military assistance to the war, saying the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered “demands moral leadership.”

* The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians, but opposes the bill. McCaul said it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution and predicted it could disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries. The fighting in the Arab world’s poorest country also has left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine.

**Trump’s Rationale on why the measure was unnecessary**

* **Except for counter-terrorism operations against Islamic State militants and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.**

* **This is NOT the first time that Trump used veto power - his first veto power was used last month on legislation related to immigration. Trump had declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct a border wall. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration and Trump vetoed that measure [(Just something to note - most American Presidents have more vetos than Trump so far)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes).**",worldnews,r/worldnews,2019-04-17T00:30:25.000Z,comment,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Short, What happened (Credit goes to Journalist and AP News)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a break with the president, Congress voted for the first time earlier this month to invoke the War Powers Resolution to try to stop U.S. involvement in a foreign conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The veto — the second in Trump’s presidency — was expected. Congress lacks the votes to override him - Despite the fact that Both the House and the Senate voted to end US involvement. House approval of the resolution came earlier this month on a 247-175 vote and The Senate vote last month was 54-46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response from Trump and the Congress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump wrote in explaining his veto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has grown uneasy with Trump’s close relationship with Saudi Arabia as he tries to further isolate Iran, a regional rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lawmakers also criticized the president for not condemning Saudi Arabia for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States and had written critically about the kingdom. Khashoggi went into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October and never came out. Intelligence agencies said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was complicit in the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. provides billions of dollars of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen. &lt;strong&gt;Members of Congress have expressed concern about the thousands of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes since the conflict began in 2014.&lt;/strong&gt; Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, voted to end U.S. military assistance to the war, saying the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered “demands moral leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians, but opposes the bill. McCaul said it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution and predicted it could disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries. The fighting in the Arab world’s poorest country also has left millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and has pushed the country to the brink of famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump’s Rationale on why the measure was unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except for counter-terrorism operations against Islamic State militants and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the United States is not engaged in hostilities in or affecting Yemen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were no U.S. military personnel in Yemen accompanying the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthis, even though the U.S. has provided limited support to the coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics support, and — until recently — in-flight refueling of non-U.S. aircraft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would harm bilateral relations and interferes with his constitutional power as commander in chief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. is providing the support to protect the safety of more than 80,000 Americans who live in certain areas of the coalition countries subject to Houthi attacks from Yemen: “Houthis, supported by Iran, have used missiles, armed drones and explosive boats to attack civilian and military targets in those coalition countries, including areas frequented by American citizens, such as the airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,” Trump said. “In addition, the conflict in Yemen represents a ‘cheap’ and inexpensive way for Iran to cause trouble for the United States and for our ally, Saudi Arabia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

"I have always loved this poem about Yemenis by Heinrich Heine:

 

Every day so lovely, shining,  
up and down, the Sultan’s daughter  
walked at evening by the water,  
where the white fountain splashes.  


Every day the young slave stood  
by the water, in the evening,  
where the white fountain splashes,  
each day growing pale and paler.  


Then the princess came one evening,  
quickly speaking to him, softly,  
‘Your true name – I wish to know it,  
your true homeland and your nation.’  


And the slave said, ‘I am called  
Mahomet, I am from Yemen,

&lt;p&gt;Every day so lovely, shining,&lt;br/&gt;
up and down, the Sultan’s daughter&lt;br/&gt;
walked at evening by the water,&lt;br/&gt;
where the white fountain splashes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day the young slave stood&lt;br/&gt;
by the water, in the evening,&lt;br/&gt;
where the white fountain splashes,&lt;br/&gt;
each day growing pale and paler.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the princess came one evening,&lt;br/&gt;
quickly speaking to him, softly,&lt;br/&gt;
‘Your true name – I wish to know it,&lt;br/&gt;
your true homeland and your nation.’  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the slave said, ‘I am called&lt;br/&gt;
Mahomet, I am from Yemen,&lt;br/&gt;
and my tribe, it is the Asra,&lt;br/&gt;
who die, when they love.’&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Absolutely right. Sure, Yemen is a shithole. But at least Saudi is an ally, and relatively civilized. A bad ally, but for the short term, a necessary one.

&gt; Because we're helping the sane Arabs take back the middle east from the insane ones. And it might just work because it's the ""locals' doing it and not Westerners.

&gt; Yemen is scum. Pound for pound they produce more terrorists than any other country.

&gt;What people don't realize is if we don't provide the minimal support we currently do, that Iran will essentially take over Yemen but secondly, leaving targeting up to the Saudis will just lead to an even worse humanitarian issue since they'll just carpet bomb anything that moves whereas we actually provide good targeting.I hate proxy wars as much as the next guy, but we're cleaning up Obama's mess and giving it up to Iran like Obama did with Iraq isn't going to help.

&gt;The Left controlled the Saudis and Trump's biggest coup was ending that shit. Think about why the Left has supported Iran, NK, ISIS, etc. We're ending that shit.

"What a fucking useless neo-con. 

His cult on r/T_D are legit justifying it by saying Iran is a threat and that Saudi Arabia is a ""civilized"" and ""necessary"" ally.

&gt;Absolutely right. Sure, Yemen is a shithole. But at least Saudi is an ally, and relatively civilized. A bad ally, but for the short term, a necessary one.

&gt;Because we're helping the sane Arabs take back the middle east from the insane ones. And it might just work because it's the ""locals' doing it and not Westerners.
