Chelsea Clinton married a jew and converted.

But

Don Jr married Vanessa Trump, who's father was Jewish. I don't believe Vanessa is Jewish and I don't believe Don Jr ever converted. They divorced.

"Hitler was a leftist. 

Comparing Trump to Nazi Germany reminds me of the type of scapegoating the Nazis used to do. Every day he is called both incredibly incompetent on one hand, and literally Hitler on the other hand. Which is it? Uncanny how much it resembles Hitler saying the Jews ran the world on one hand, while saying they are weak on the other. The left is using him and his supporters as a scapegoat to push a dangerous ideology. Using Trump as your Reichstag fire to seize control, pack the courts, undermine the legislative filibuster. If any party resembles the Nazis rise to power it's the left. 

The left believes factors like race, ethnicity, and gender are the primary political unit, not the individual. They don't believe in strong property rights. They believe it is the governments responsibility to solve social problems. They call for public intervention to equalize disparities and render our social fabric more ""inclusive"". By those definitions the Nazis are firmly on the left, a collectivist authoritarian movement run by social justice warriors.

Hitler called for: “equality of rights for the German people.”, the end of rent slavery, confiscation of war profits, the nationalization of industry, profit sharing in heavy industry, large scale social security, free expropriation of privately owned land for the purpose of public utility, the nationalization of education, nationalization of healthcare for mother and child, and state regulation of the press. If you are going to boil down Hitler to just racism and anti-immigration, you are missing all the leftist ideas that got him there. German lives were for the betterment of the people and state.

"The Holocaust happened, but it was no worse than Americans interning the Japanese. There was no plan to kill all the Jews, and six million didn't die.

Starvation was the other cause, seeing how the Allies destroyed their supply lines. 

I'm not an anti-Semite. I don't think the Jews are behind it all, I think it was originally the Soviets who actually forbid the western powers from even visiting the camps, and then it got perpetuated by the Hollywood and media industries.
