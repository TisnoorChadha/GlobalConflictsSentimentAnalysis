"A big issue is that this current war is pointless as fuck. Isreal isnt gonna lose by force, they can easily outlast hamas and starve out the whole of palestina. Hell they are already doing it. So that means that all changes have to come from diplomatic shit. Or atleast give Isreal a proper other option.

Because currently if Isreal consedeces than they ensure that Hamas will always rule palestina meaning they create a legitemate souvering enemy state right of their border, something that not even the most progressive, leftleaning pacafist Isrealian would see as a viable option.

So yeah its might be a form of colonialisme and all that shit but unlike other colonial conflicts Isreal is fighting on their home groun for their continued survival. They dont have the logistical issues that european powers had in the 60s, they dont have the moral issue that their citizens dont want to fight some poor villager on rhe other side of the globe. 

Every colonial conflict was won by the natives not because they had superior millitary power but because colonial occupation became to expensive economically, morally and diplomaticly.

Here is an example of what happens 

In this video you see an explosion on top of that building but notice the whole building didn’t come down. No major damage was done to the building. 

Why? 

Israel is shooting a warning shot meaning within a few minutes this whole building is going to be destroyed so any civilians should get the fuck out. 


As you can imagine if you’re a civilian in this situation you probably have shat your pants and have no idea what just happened. A few minutes to get out of this building while everyone is rushing out is difficult. You get out of your apartment and there are hundreds of people running down the stairs. 

You legit might not make it but some will and that’s why Israel sends the warning shot.

To align with rule 1, make every attempt to be polite in tone, charitable in your interpretations, fair in your arguments and patient in your explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t debate the person, debate the argument; use terms towards a debate opponent that they or their relevant group(s) would self-identify with whenever possible. You may use negative characterizations towards a group in a specific context that distinguishes the negative characterization from the positive -- that means insulting opinions are allowed as a necessary part of an argument, but are prohibited in place of an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

"It's completely possible (and often the case) for multiple parties to be simultaneously understandable, yet wholely condemnable, when it comes to violent actions.  
Israel should not be confining those in the Gaza strip to such horrible conditions. The settlements need to not only stop, but be withdrawn from much (if not all) of the West Bank. However, there is clearly a security risk posed to Israelis by those in Gaza. Hamas aren't attacking Israel because of the settlements and they'd just as soon kill every Jewish person if they had the chance to, it's literally part of their creed and the backbone to the foundation of Hamas.  
It's understandable why those in Palestine would want to fight back. It's not acceptable to capture, torture, rape, murder and defile the corpses of civilians from Israel, though. Recording yourselves doing it and throwing it into the internet to show off your savagery to the world reveals far more intent than simply ""freedom fighting."" Anyone who says this is ""based"" or ""revolutionary"" is showing their true colors. 80 years ago they would be cheering on Jews being trained off to Auschwitz.  
The deaths of Palestinians far outnumber the deaths of Israelis, for a variety of reasons, and it's fair to take that into account when weighing up the responsibilities of both sides to end these struggles. But remember, while Israel might dwarf Palestine on its own, Israel stands against a wave of enemies in the Middle East. If Palestinians stopped fighting, perhaps conditions would grow worse for them, or perhaps not. If Israel stops fighting, it will cease to exist, and all her citizens are likely to face the same treatment you've seen today in videos spammed across Twitter and the news today.  
The violence is tragic, none of it should be celebrated, no one should be giddy for vengeance or continuous bloodshed.

"It is worse than I thought it would be but I thought something was coming. 

I have seen the Palestinians being pushed into a corner, losing more and more land, videos of IDF forces committing small day to day dehumanizing actions and no one helping the Palestinians.

"I have to disagree with this assessment. These two cases differ significantly. For one, Jews have lived in the Israeli-Palestinian territories along side the Arabic people for over a thousand years, they didn’t just appear after WWII. They were there before the partition of the late 40s, they were there long before that and have fluctuated in prominent populations with the Palestinians for centuries. 

The first partition that was proposed in the late 1940s would have created an autonomous Palestinian state, which is what people are demanding today. This state would have taken up roughly half of the Israeli-Palestinian territory. 

The Israelis accepted the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and war broke out a year later. The Palestinians got their shit rocked and Israel took control of far more territory than was first proposed. 

Then war broke out again 20 years later and the Arab states again got their shit kicked in and that’s when Israel took full control of the territory. 

I do empathize with the Palestinians and neither government is innocent in this generational conflict, but it has to be said, the Palestinian leaders have always, always, led their people to worse and worse outcomes. 

Gaza is about to be flatted for this attack. I hate that this is going to happen but I known it’s coming. Israel has never had a more right wing government as they have right now. These two sides have never wanted to wipe eachother out more than they do today. 

It’s going to get bad, folks are going to hate Israel for what they’re about to do but there is going to be no room for doubt on the Israeli side this time.

These two cases differ significantly. For one, Jews have lived in the Israeli-Palestinian territories along side the Arabic people for over a thousand years, they didn’t just appear after WWII. They were there before the partition of the late 40s, they were there long before that and have fluctuated in prominent populations with the Palestinians for centuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first partition that was proposed in the late 1940s would have created an autonomous Palestinian state, which is what people are demanding today. This state would have taken up roughly half of the Israeli-Palestinian territory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis accepted the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and war broke out a year later. The Palestinians got their shit rocked and Israel took control of far more territory than was first proposed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then war broke out again 20 years later and the Arab states again got their shit kicked in and that’s when Israel took full control of the territory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do empathize with the Palestinians and neither government is innocent in this generational conflict, but it has to be said, the Palestinian leaders have always, always, led their people to worse and worse outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaza is about to be flatted for this attack. I hate that this is going to happen but I known it’s coming. Israel has never had a more right wing government as they have right now. These two sides have never wanted to wipe eachother out more than they do today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to get bad, folks are going to hate Israel for what they’re about to do but there is going to be no room for doubt on the Israeli side this time. They may very well end all presence of the Arabic people in the Israeli-Palestinians territory.&lt;/p&gt;

"This comment takes many things out of context. For one the two stage solution was rejected because the border drawn up was unfair and allotted a majority of the „good territory“ to Jewish people and a lot of the dry desert territory to the Arabs. 

It also seems to not mention that Jews and Arabs have lived there peacefully before in the British mandate and in the former ottoman territory but it wasn’t until the Balfour declaration when Jews started arriving en Masse despite many of them having no historic ties to the area and with many of them coming from Europe. 

While i do agree Palestinian authorities sold their people out and people like yasser Arafat made money off their plight let’s not ignore the fact that there is a clear aggressor here who dishes out violence in a staggeringly different proportion and also enforces a literal apartheid state. Which you can see on Humans rights watch, bt selem, or amensty international.

At the end of the day Palestinians are just tired of what is happening and I generally agree as with South Africans as with Ukrainians that they have a right to attack their oppressors. Violence isn’t pretty and you can’t expect anyone to just be fine with decades long apartheid to sit idly by and let their country slowly be taken by pieces while having blockades and sanctions placed on them by a literal nuclear power which people seem to forget.

"The argument they are making is to refute the idea that the person they were responding to is that the only reason why the Jews left the Levant was due to violence is ahistorical. 

How long does a people have a claim to a land?

Then, an argument could be made that Palestinians have a greater claim to the area as their people pre-date Judaism as a whole. 

Yes, it is a complex issue with much history but it boils down to - as many conflicts do - to power and resources.

How many death tolls would it be over decades? And what if Palestine counts up Men and Women deaths over decades?  

Is it not the desperate anger ? 

Idk, I really don't want to see all this,  I wish I had the power to do something for Both Parties. 

 
""The narrative of Israel being under attack is misleading. No one condones violence. Palestine has been under attack, and the media and most of the world stayed silent.""

But what is the best way to handle this situation?",IsraelPalestine,r/IsraelPalestine,2023-10-08T15:03:42.000Z,comment,,,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;#39;t be commenting because I&amp;#39;m someone who believes in Freedom, peace. But it seems like peace doesn&amp;#39;t exist when there are 2 different beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is killing slowly over time better or Showing all the anger at once of being the victims for decades better?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, what&amp;#39;s the solution?  Why is it happening?&lt;/p&gt;

"Disturbingly, in this conflict and most others, many human lives are not perceived as being of equal value/worth, when morally we all definitely should and even could be.

In fact, human beings can actually be perceived and treated as though they are disposable and, by extension, their suffering and death are somehow less worthy of external concern, sometimes even by otherwise democratic and relatively civilized nations.

A somewhat similar inhumane devaluation is observable in external attitudes, albeit perhaps on a subconscious level, toward the daily civilian lives lost in protractedly devastating war zones and famine-stricken nations.

The worth of such life will be measured by its overabundance and/or the protracted conditions under which it suffers; and those people can eventually receive meagre column inches on the back page of the First World’s daily news.

"Both sides have been resolving to terror. What we are seeing now, and in the past, from Hamas is without a doubt terrorism and it's despicable. 
Make no mistake that,  while I support Israel, they too have killed over 2500 Palestinian children in the last 3 years. 

Israel has a large and sophisticated military and and justifies their killing and land grab as part of their fight against terrorism, but make no mistake they have been killing Palestinians and taking their homes and lands since 1948. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, don't have the firepower to go against the Israeli military. Hence, they resolve to rerrorism. 

Neither side is innocent. they're killing civilians, and that has to stop. 

If you look at the Israelis, they're all white. Northern European White. Most of them, at least. 

All relocated from Europe after WWII. Europe didn't want the Jews so instead of ""expelling"" them, they created the state of Israel in Palestine under the pretext that this was their promised land. 

Simply, you have Jews relocating to Israel from all over the world as long as they're Jewish, they can be Israeli citizens. In 1922 there were less than 100,000 Jewish people living in Palestine.

Jews left the area 2500 years ago. 
While they do have a claim in the area, you can not ethnic cleans those who live in the area you're taking over.  

Palestinians, on the other hand, are natives of that land never moved away. 

This land grab has been going on for over 80 years. 
Give Palestine its statehood, and all these senseless wars will stop.
Both sides must coexist there's no power way. 

European powers and USA support Israel because they don't want the Jews in their countries. If they stop supporting Israel, Iran along with some Arab nations will push the Israelis out very quickly. In turn 6million Jews will be back in Europe and USA. And they simply don't want ray.

"Kinda, my position has always been:

- IDF has to admit to its crimes and be held responsible for its atrocities
- Palestinians in Israel need to have the same civil rights as the Israelis
- Israel needs to stop their forced settlement in Palestinian areas
- Israel needs to protect its democracy from theocratic authoritarians like Netanjahu 

But also:
- Israel needs to be protected as the only democracy and free country in the region and should always be allowed to protect itself

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDF has to admit to its crimes and be held responsible for its atrocities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palestinians in Israel need to have the same civil rights as the Israelis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel needs to stop their forced settlement in Palestinian areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Israel needs to protect its democracy from theocratic authoritarians like Netanjahu &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also:
- Israel needs to be protected as the only democracy and free country in the region and should always be allowed to protect itself
- Gaza needs to be cleansed of the Hamas so these terrorists don&amp;#39;t have their grip and anti Semitic manipulation over the Palestinians anymore
